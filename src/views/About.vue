      There is really nothing special about me ðŸ˜¶ <br />But if you really want to 
      know what differentiates me from the rest <br />well i tend to put
       200% effort in everything i do, a very good example is this portfolio site, three different versions just to proof a point (<i>not necessary but what's the harm in trying</i>)
        <br>So if you in search for someone that can deliver, then am your guy. <br>what else ðŸ¤” hmmm, am nineteen with three years of software development experience, 
        Upcoming B.Engr in computer Engineering (<i>Hopefully</i> ), Founder of Kromtech (<i>We build softwares to help out students and make their lifes easier</i>). I think that's all, If you want to find out more hit me up on <a href="https://twitter.com/kromate_24">twitter</a>
        Also check out my Vanilla Js <a href="https://github.com/kromate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">portfolio</a>, it has more content on me ( <i>I guess</i> )
